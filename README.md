# Sabrina Markon · Project Archive

A curated collection of my real-world development work, built to showcase experience across legacy systems, modern stacks, and full application lifecycles.

## 🔍 About

This archive includes projects I've developed, maintained, or led—ranging from long-running client systems to creative side projects and team-built apps. Most are written in:

- **PHP** (Laravel, custom frameworks, Magento 2 / Adobe Commerce)
- **JavaScript** (React, jQuery, Node.js)
- **Blade + Tailwind** (for modern Laravel views)
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL** (for backend data)

You can use this archive to:
- View code and architecture examples
- Understand my decision-making and technical approaches
- Download summaries and interview-ready documentation

## 🧠 Why This Archive Exists

Most developers showcase only brand-new work. I’ve taken a different route—preserving legacy, real, and production-tested work I’ve done over the years.

Many projects were made under tight constraints (deadlines, client quirks, old systems), and I’ve included:
- **Code insights**: What I knew, built, or learned
- **Candidate context**: What this shows about me as a developer
- **Files**: Each project may include a GitHub README, PDF summary, chat log, and interview questions

## 📂 Featured Projects

| Project | Summary | Tech Stack |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **PearlsOfWealth** | Custom email marketing platform that ran for 10+ years with 31 servers and automated peer-to-peer systems | PHP, MySQL, HTML, Bash |
| **Banner Maker** | Laravel-based banner creator with user library, templates, and server-side rendering | Laravel 5.2, jQuery, ImageMagick |
| *(More coming soon)* | Project summaries will be posted as I continue this archive | |

Each project includes links to:
- GitHub repo or code folder
- Project summary (`.docx`)
- Interview-style Q&A
- Real code analysis

## 🚀 What’s Next

This archive is part of a larger site hosted at [sabrinamarkon.com](https://sabrinamarkon.com) (in progress). Over time, I’ll include:

- Laravel Livewire/Inertia.js examples
- A searchable archive browser
- AI-assisted module generation (Laravel + OpenAI)
