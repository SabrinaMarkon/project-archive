## Session 1: Portfolio Design Implementation
**Date:** ~2025-10-27 (Previous session - reconstructed from code)

### Overview
Applied a complete sage green and natural color theme design to all public-facing pages of the portfolio site.

### Pages Updated

#### Welcome.tsx (Route: `/`)
- Integrated PortfolioLayout
- Assembled full portfolio homepage:
  - HeroSection
  - FeaturedProjects (first 3 projects)
  - WritingSection
  - AboutSection
  - ContactSection
- Receives `projects` prop from Laravel controller

#### Projects/Index.tsx (Route: `/projects`)
- Applied PortfolioLayout
- "All Projects" header section
- Full project grid (all projects, not just featured)
- Each project card:
  - Sage green icon box
  - Title and description
  - "View Project" link
  - Hover effects (shadow, translate)
- ContactSection at bottom
- Light green background for grid

#### Projects/Show.tsx (Route: `/projects/{slug}`)
- Applied PortfolioLayout
- "Back to All Projects" link with arrow
- Project header with icon and title
- Project content card with description

- White header, light green content background

### Reference File Created
- **portfolio_layout-sage.tsx** (`public/`)
  - Complete standalone example of the design
  - All sections in one file for reference
  - Includes hardcoded sample data

### Technical Details
- Used lucide-react icons throughout
- Inline styles for color values (easier to maintain theme)
- Tailwind utility classes for layout/spacing
- Hover animations: scale, translate, shadow, gap transitions
- Responsive grid: `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))`
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Context: WSL Migration
- Project was moved to WSL filesystem for better hot reloading
- Vite's file watcher works better on native Linux filesystem
- Hot module replacement now works reliably for instant feedback

## Session 2: Documentation & Conversation Persistence
**Date:** 2025-10-27

### Topics Covered

#### WSL Filesystem Access from Windows
- Discussed Windows paths to access WSL filesystem:
  - `\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\sabrina\project-archive`
  - `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\sabrina\project-archive`
- Can use `explorer.exe .` from within WSL to open current directory in Windows Explorer
- Can pin WSL directories to Windows Quick Access

#### Chat History & Conversation Persistence
- Discovered previous chat session disappeared
- Explored Claude Code's built-in conversation persistence features:

  **Resume Commands:**
  - `claude --continue` - Resume most recent conversation
  - `claude --resume` - Interactive list to choose from conversation history

  **Memory System:**
  - Project memory: `CLAUDE.md` (already exists with architecture docs)
  - User memory: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  - Quick save: Start messages with `#` to save to memory
  - Edit memory: `/memory` command

  **How it works:**
  - All conversations automatically saved locally
  - Full message history and tool usage preserved
  - Can resume any previous session

#### Session Notes System (This File)
- Created `SESSION_NOTES.md` to document work sessions
- Acts as backup to conversation history
- Git-tracked for version control
- Documents:
  - What was worked on
  - Changes made
  - Design decisions
  - Technical context
  - Next steps

### Files Modified in This Session
- Created: `SESSION_NOTES.md`

## Session 3: Design Refinements & Frontend Testing
**Date:** 2025-10-27

### Design Refinements

#### ContactSection Background Color Exploration
- **Issue Identified:** ContactSection (`#d4e5c8` light green) blended with project list background on `/projects` route
  - Looked good on `/` route due to alternating section colors
  - Needed better separation on pages with single background color

- **Colors Tested:**
  1. Golden/warm `#f4e4c1` - Rejected (would match AboutSection on homepage)
  2. Very light cream `#f9f7f4` - Tested, user preferred white
  3. **White `#ffffff`** - ✅ Selected for clean, professional look

#### Navigation & Footer Refinements
- Tested matching nav and footer with light cream `#f9f7f4` for "frame" effect
- User preferred white for maximum professionalism and clarity
- **Final decision:** Both navigation and footer use white backgrounds
  - Navigation: Translucent white `bg-white/90` with backdrop blur
  - Footer: Solid white with contained border line (inside max-width container)
  - Border moved inside footer content area for cleaner appearance

#### Minor Fixes
- Fixed copyright symbol display (was showing as `�`, now properly displays `©`)
- Removed unused React import from PortfolioLayout.tsx (TypeScript warning)

### Frontend Test Suite Implementation

Created comprehensive Vitest + React Testing Library test suite for all public-facing portfolio pages.

#### Test Files Created
- `resources/js/Pages/__tests__/Welcome.test.tsx` (7 tests)
- `resources/js/Pages/__tests__/Projects.Index.test.tsx` (12 tests)
- `resources/js/Pages/__tests__/Projects.Show.test.tsx` (16 tests)

**Total: 41 tests, all passing ✅**

#### Test Coverage

**1. Welcome (/) page:**
- Layout rendering
- Page title
- All portfolio sections present
- Project data passed correctly
- Section order
- Empty state handling

**2. Projects Index (/projects):**
- All projects displayed
- Descriptions (including null handling)
- Links to individual projects
- Empty state message
- Large project lists
- Styling and layout

**3. Projects Show (/projects/{slug}):**
- Individual project display
- Back to projects link
- Description rendering (including null/empty)
- Long text handling
- Whitespace preservation
- Layout and styling

#### Testing Setup Details
- **Framework:** Vitest (native Vite integration, faster than Jest)
- **Testing Library:** @testing-library/react v16
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Inertia components (`Head`, `Link`) mocked for isolated testing
  - Portfolio components mocked with test IDs
  - Allows unit testing of page structure without dependency complexity
- **Configuration:** Test setup in `vite.config.js` with jsdom environment

#### Test Commands
```bash
npm test          # Watch mode
npm test -- --run # Single run
npm run test:ui   # Visual UI
```

#### Why Vitest?
1. Native Vite integration - shares config/plugins with build tool
2. Significantly faster than Jest
3. Native ESM support without configuration
4. Jest-compatible API (familiar syntax)
5. Hot Module Replacement for tests

### Files Modified in This Session
- Modified: `resources/js/Components/Portfolio/ContactSection.tsx`
  - Changed background from `#d4e5c8` to `#ffffff`
- Modified: `resources/js/Layouts/PortfolioLayout.tsx`
  - Tested cream backgrounds for nav/footer
  - Reverted to white for both
  - Moved footer border inside content container
  - Fixed copyright symbol
  - Removed unused React import
- Created: `resources/js/Pages/__tests__/Welcome.test.tsx`
- Created: `resources/js/Pages/__tests__/Projects.Index.test.tsx`
- Created: `resources/js/Pages/__tests__/Projects.Show.test.tsx`

### Design Decisions Made
- **White for ContactSection:** Provides maximum contrast and universal compatibility
- **White for nav/footer:** Professional, clean appearance preferred over warm cream frame
- **Contained footer border:** Border constrained to max-width container instead of full-width for cleaner look
- **Test structure:** Frontend tests in `resources/js/Pages/__tests__/` separate from Laravel PHPUnit tests

## Next Steps & Open Items

### Potential Enhancements
- Add actual blog posts/writing content (currently placeholder data)
- Consider adding project tags/categories to database
- Add project images/screenshots
- Implement writing/blog functionality
- Dark mode toggle (mentioned in CLAUDE.md future enhancements)

### Known Issues
- None currently blocking

### Design Decisions to Remember
- Sage green theme chosen for natural, professional aesthetic
- Lucide-react for consistent icon system
- Inline color styles for easier theme management
- Single layout (PortfolioLayout) for all public pages
- Separate layouts maintained for admin pages (DashboardLayout, AuthenticatedLayout)

- Note any breaking changes or migrations

**With Claude Code:**
- Claude can read this file to understand recent work
- Can be updated during sessions to maintain context
- Serves as backup if conversation history is lost
- Can be referenced in CLAUDE.md via `@SESSION_NOTES.md`

**Session workflow:**
1. Start session, review SESSION_NOTES.md
2. Work on tasks
